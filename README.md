# Investments

This is a personal code repository that is used as a playing ground for Rust.
The purpose of this code is to interface with a local Postgres repository that
keeps track of my investments.

This is not really intended to build an application that is useful for anyone
else but me. On the other hand, any code in here that is of wider use, by
accident or by design, is available under the MIT license.
