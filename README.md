# Investments

This is a personal code repository that is used as a playing ground for Rust.
The purpose of this code is to interface with a local Postgres repository that
keeps track of my investments.

This is not really intended to build an application that is useful for anyone
else but me. On the other hand, any code in here that is of wider use, by
accident or by design, is available under the MIT license.

## Goals

Given that I'd like to save for early retirement, the goal of this software is
to give insight into how I'm progressing against the early retirement goal.

Features will slowly be added to help with this. For example:

- [ ] Calculation of returns.
- [ ] Prediction of future savings growth.
- [ ] Calculations of regular costs.
- [ ] Target goals.
- [ ] Graph plotting.
